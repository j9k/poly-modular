# poly-modular
Design of a polyphonic modular synthesizer with either digital or analog components.

It should be able to accomodate as many voices as the user requires and as many sound sources per voice the user needs.

Schematic and pcb design will be done with Kicad.

mechanical files will be done with freecad.

Mechanical specifications will be compatible with the eurorack modular.

Each type of synth block will consist of three parts.
1. a module that does the work
2. a module or multiple modules that distribute control voltages or mixes signals
3. a module that supplies the control voltages



Voltages supplied by the power supply +/-15 maximum with the jumper option of +/-12v
