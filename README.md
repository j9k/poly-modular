# poly-modular
Design of a polyphonic modular synthesizer with either digital or analog components

Each type of synth block will consist of three parts.

2. a module that distributes control voltages or mixes signals
3. a module that supplies the control voltages


Voltages supplied by the power supply +/-15 maximum with the option of +/-12v
